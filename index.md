I am a mathematician.
I am interested in connections between discrete and continuous structures, like
[finite graphs and dynamical systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10884-023-10334-7),
[finite groups and algebraic varieties](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jgth-2022-0110/html?lang=en),
[combinatorial sequences and analytic functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X24003706),
[matrix semigroups and hyperbolic surfaces](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6544/ac0484/meta).
