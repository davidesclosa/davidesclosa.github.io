## Dynamical Systems on Finite Graphs and Graph Limits

Dynamical systems on graphs naturally occur as models of physical phenomena: vertices represent dynamical quantities and edges represent interactions between them.
There are fascinating relations between *combinatorial structure* and *emergent collective behavior*. Here are some of my findings: contrary to popular belief, finite graphs can support infinitely many stable equilibria [infinitely many stable equilibria](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/23M155400X); the [dimension of the equilibrium set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08311) depends on the number of cycles with one common edge; [nilpotent equilibria](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12034)
are related to Eulerian paths; in joint work with C. Bick I explore graphon and graphop automorphisms to generalize symmetries, which are fundamental tools to understand dynamics on finite graphs, to [dynamics on graph limits](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10884-023-10334-7).


## Algebraic Groups Over Finite Fields
	
Linear algebraic groups over finite fields play a crucial role in the classification of finite simple groups.
Fix a linear algebraic group $$G$$ (for example $$\mathrm{GL}_m$$, $$\mathrm{SL}_m$$, $$\mathrm{SO}_m$$, $$\mathrm{Sp}_{2m}, \ldots$$).
By varying the underlying finite field we obtain a sequence of finite groups $$(G(\mathbb F_{p^n}))_{n\geq 0}$$.
On the other hand the "limit object" $$G(\overline{\mathbb F_p})$$ living on an algebraic closure is a smooth algebraic variety.
Let us call $$k$$ a *popular index* if for infinitely many $$n$$ the group $$G(\mathbb F_{p^n})$$ has a subgroup of index $$k$$.
I prove a [correspondence](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jgth-2022-0110/html?lang=en) between popular indeces and coverings of the limit object.
This problem was presented to me by P. Corvaja.


## Power Series Bounded on the Real Line and Generating Functions

The existence of power series that are bounded on the whole real line (consider for example $$\sin(x)$$, $$e^{-x^2/2}$$, or $$e^{1-e^x}$$)
is in itself a remarkable fact: infinitely many monomials have to balance each other out, uniformly, on an unbounded set
(in contrast, bounded power series on the complex plane are constant).
[Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X24003706), I analyze the set of bounded power series on the real line and
investigate necessary conditions in terms of the coefficient sequence. Results of this kind are particularly important in the case of bounded generating functions, like $$e^{1-e^x}$$, in which the coefficient sequence carries combinatorial meaning. On this matter, I am unable to close a certain gap, which I leave open as a conjecture.

## Joint Spectral Radius

The normalized spectral radius of an $$n$$-long product of two matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$ is the $$n$$-th root of its spectral radius.
The joint spectral radius is the supremum of the normalized spectral radii of all finite products.
The *Lagariasâ€“Wang finiteness conjecture* states that this supremum is a maximum, that is, there is a finite product of $$A$$ and $$B$$ that realizes
the maximum normalized spectral radius. This conjecture is false for real matrices and open for rational matrices.
Together with G. Panti, I prove that [the conjecture holds](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6544/ac0484/meta) in $$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z_{\geq 0})$$.
We apply the result to the study of hyperbolic billiards.
