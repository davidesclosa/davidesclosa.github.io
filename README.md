## Dynamical Systems, Finite Graphs, and Graph Limits

<details>
<summary>Dynamical systems on graphs occur naturally as models of real-life phenomena...</summary>

Dynamical systems on graphs occur naturally as models of real-life phenomena. Typically, vertices represent some dynamical quantities and edges represent interactions between them.
I am particularly fascinated by the connections between the underlying *combinatorial structure* and *emergent collective behavior*. These are some of my findings: contrary to popular belief, finite graphs can support infinitely many stable equilibria [infinitely many stable equilibria](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/23M155400X); the [dimension of the equilibrium set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08311) depends on the number of graph cycles with one edge in common; [nilpotent equilibria](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12034)
are related to Eulerian paths. In joint work with C.Bick, I explore graphon and graphop automorphism groups to generalize symmetries, a fundamental tool to understand dynamical systems on finite graphs,
to [dynamical systems on graph limits](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10884-023-10334-7).

## Algebraic Groups Over Finite Fields
Linear algebraic groups over finite fields play a crucial role in the classification of finite simple groups.
Fix a linear algebraic group $$G$$ (for example $$\mathrm{GL}_m$$, $$\mathrm{SL}_m$$, $$\mathrm{SO}_m$$, $$\mathrm{Sp}_{2m}$$, ...).
By varying the underlying finite field we obtain a sequence of *discrete* finite groups

$$
	G(\mathbb F_p),\ G(\mathbb F_{p^2}),\ \ldots,\ G(\mathbb F_{p^n}), \ldots .
$$

On the other hand the "limit object" $$G(\overline{\mathbb F_p})$$ living on an algebraic closure is a *smooth* algebraic variety.
Let us call $$k$$ a *popular index* if for infinitely many $$n$$ the group $$G(\mathbb F_{p^n})$$ has a subgroup of index $$k$$.
I prove a [correspondence](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jgth-2022-0110/html?lang=en) between popular indeces and coverings of the limit object.
This problem was presented to me by P.Corvaja.

## Bounded Power Series and Generating Functions

The bounded functions $$\sin(x)$$, $$e^{-x^2/2}$$, and $$e^{1-e^x}$$ can be written as a sigle power series convergent and bounded on the whole real line.
For a power series, boundedness on a line is a remarkable property: infinitely many monomials have to balance each other out, uniformly, on an unbounded set. In a recent paper
I analyze the set of complex power series [bounded on the real line](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X24003706) and, in particular,
I give necessary conditions for boundedness in terms of the coefficient sequence. Results of this king are particularly important in the case of bounded generating functions, like $$e^{1-e^x}$$, in which the coefficient sequence carries combinatorial meaning. On this matter, I am unable to close a certain gap, which I leave open as a conjecture.
